``rmt'' or Ross's Monitoring Tool is a network monitoring tool 
designed to work with the University of Glasgow's Raspberry Pi 
Cloud. It's primary purpose is to provide an at-a-glance view of the 
status and resource usage of each Raspberry Pi and their respective 
Linux containers.

The University of Glasgow's Raspberry Pi Cloud \cite{glapicloud} (which will now be 
referred to as PiCloud, not to be confused with PiCloud Inc.) is not 
wholly unique, as other institutions have created similar projects.
