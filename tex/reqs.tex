\label{sec:reqs}
Requirements were discussed in weekly meetings with the aforementioned product owner and supervisor of the project, David White.
These requirements were then noted and added to the Trello page for the project, further discussed in section \ref{sec:trello}, and given a priority of one of: ``Must have'', ``Should have'', ``Could have'', ``Would like to have'', commonly known as the MoSCoW framework \citep{moscow}.

\subsection{Must Have}
\label{sec:musthave}
\begin{description}
	\item[Keep client daemon(s) lightweight] given the Raspberry Pi's lack of resources, any applications running should use as little resources as possible
	\item[Monitor all hosts] the user should be able to monitor all 56 hosts
	\item[``at-a-glance'' monitoring] the user should not have to scroll to view all 56 hosts
	\item[Monitor resource usage of all hosts] the system should be able to display a given host's resource usage (RAM and CPU usage)
	\item[Temperature monitoring] the system should display the temperature of a given host
	\item[Delete a host] the user should be able to delete hosts from the system to stop monitoring it
	\item[Server state persists after reboot] the system should remain the same after a reboot of Pi Master
	\item[Heartbeat] the application should include some kind of heartbeat to indicate whether a host is turned on and responding
\end{description}

\subsection{Should Have}
\label{sec:shouldhave}
\begin{description}
	\item[Reboot a host] the user should be able to reboot a host from the system
	\item[View historical data] there should be some graphs to show the user historical data regarding resource usage and temperature
	\item[Monitor resource usage of containers] monitoring the resources used by the containers
\end{description}

\subsection{Could Have}
\label{sec:couldhave}
\begin{description}
	\item[Extensibility] the application should be extensible
	\item[Scalability] the application should scale well to allow for additional hosts
	\item[Secure login] the user should have to log in to view the application to allow for remote access and user privileges
\end{description}

\subsection{Would like to have}
\label{sec:wouldhave}
\begin{description}
	\item[Non-monitoring container operations] any function related to containers that are not monitoring, such as:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item kill containers
		\item restart containers
		\item start containers
		\item stop containers
	\end{itemize}
	\item[create container images remotely] containers need an image to be created from, this could be done remotely
	\item[``nice'' website] the website should be user-friendly
