\label{intro:pisupercomp}

It should be noted that University of Southampton also created a cluster of Raspberry Pi devices and before the University of Glasgow did according to the PiCloud blog \citep{picloudblog}, however theirs was designed to create a single, miniature super-computer.
This is sufficiently different in design and purpose from PiCloud as to disregard it for the purposes of this study.
