\begin{abstract}
I would like to thank David White for his endless patience, advice and for always ending our meetings with the phrase, ``Go achieve!''.
My thanks also go to all of the participants of my user evaluation, without whom the evaluation would not have been complete.
Additionally I would like to thank the School of Computer Science in general who, for the vast majority of my time at University of Glasgow, have been extremely supportive.
