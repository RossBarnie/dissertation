\begin{abstract}
I would like to thank David White for his endless patience, advice and for always ending our meetings with the phrase, ``Go achieve!''.
Additionally I would like to thank the School of Computer Science in general who have for the vast majority of my time at University of Glasgow been extremely supportive.
